This is the Mission Console debugger.  The project will grow as the class progresses.
Each student can use the console if their Arduino projects implement the proper
data transfer protocol over the USB2UART channel.  The wiki pages will explain each
dialog and how to populate it for graphical debugging.

REvISION HISTORY:

	02-16-11 - Start of document.  Project is ugly and needs some continuity 
			with regards to naming conventions but is working.  At this
			point it is still useless but does connect and disconnect from
			system COM ports and creates a csv file for IR debugging as
			per the lab requirements.  The contents of that file still
			need to be worked on. -sg
